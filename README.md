Word Frequency Finder is an Elixir programme that finds the frequency of words within a text. The text used here is Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN or the old English Epic BEOWULF.

To run this app, install elixir

Then, within the `word_frequency_finder` directory, run the command:

`mix frankenstein` for FRANKENSTEIN, or `mix beowulf` for BEOWULF.
