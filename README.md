Word Frequency Finder is an Elixir programme that finds the frequency of words within a text. The text used here is Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN or the old English Epic BEOWULF.

To run this app, install elixir

Then, within the `word_frequency_finder` directory, run the command:

`mix frankenstein` or

`mix beowulf` along with the amount of words you want to be in the ranking.

For instance, for the top 50 words from Beowulf the command would be:

`mix beowulf 50`
